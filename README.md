## Installation
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm (for React)
- PostgreSQL (or another DBMS if you prefer)
- Git ( for cloning repo )

### Backend Setup (Django)
1. Clone the repository:

    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/NagarajMurgod/Social-Media-App.git 
    cd Social-Media-App
    ```
2. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ``` 
    cd api 
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Set up the database (PostgreSQL):

- Ensure PostgreSQL is running, and create a new database for the project.
- Update the database configuration in backend/settings.py with your database credentials.

5. Run migrations to set up the database schema:

    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
6. Create a superuser (for admin access):

    ```
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
7. Start the backend server:

    ```
    python manage.py runserve
    ```

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```
    cd ../client
    ```
2. Install the required npm dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Set up environment variables
    - Create a .env file in the frontend directory with the following:

        ```
        VITE_API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'
        ```
4. Start the frontend development server:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

The frontend will now be running at http://localhost:5173/.

## Usage

Once both servers are up, you can access the frontend at http://localhost:5173/ and start interacting with the app.
